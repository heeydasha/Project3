           You may be asking yourself, "What is a Korean Lunchbox Cake?" It's almost exactly what it sounds like! These cute petite-sized desserts are packaged in takeout boxes.
            Korean cafes and bakeries first popularized them. They are known for their minimalist aesthetic desserts. Personally, my favortie Korean treat is called "Yakgwa". It's a delicious honey pastry.
            Imagine eating dried doughy treat that tasted slightly like a glazed donut! Amazing right?? Here are two Korean deserts I recomend trying!

          <ul>

             <li>
             <p>A Hotteok (Sweet Pancake) is a pancake with a surprise in the middle. Bite into it to find a savory warm brown sugar flavored syrup 
             along with the crispiness of the pancake. It's as perfecr as it sounds. You can find these in the frozen isle at H-mart. Add a little butter
             into a hot pan and add your Hotteok in! You can thank me later.</p>

            <li>
             <p> Bungeoppang (Fish-shaped bread with Sweet Red Bean paste)
              This sweet desert is my sister's favortie! Similar to the Hotteok, you can bite into this warm pastry to find a delicous red bean paste. 
              Want to get a glimpse of this desert? See if you have a "SomiSomi" in your area. They serve something called a "Ah-Boong" which is almost the same as a 
              Bungeoppang except in the middle you can find ICECREAM. That's right I said ICECREAM.</p>

          <p>Korean Desserts are known for their minimalist look. Personally, I think that's why they becomme trendy.
          Sometimes people don't want to buy a entire cake to eat. A lunchbox cake is the perfect size for yourself or 
          to share with a friend. If you have time, just google Korean Deserts to see what I am talking about. Did you know
          that the Korean Bakery culture is taken very seriously? There's plently of bakerys in Korea that specializes in 
          different delicous treats.
